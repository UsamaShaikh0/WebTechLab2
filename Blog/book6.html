	<p>The Forty Rules of Love (2010) is a novel by Turkish author Elif Shafak. Often considered the most popular female novelist in Turkey, Shafak meshes Eastern and Western cultures in her stories of women and minorities. The Forty Rules of Love is her follow-up to the 2007 release, The Bastard of Istanbul. The Forty Rules of Love combines a contemporary storyline with a narrative set in the thirteenth century.

	The present time story is set in Massachusetts. Ella Rubinstein is a forty-year-old suburban wife and mother of three. Her husband is unfaithful and her life is routine. After twenty years of marriage, she abandons her family and the life she has been living and files for divorce. She tells her daughter, who has just decided to marry, that love is fleeting and does not last for long. Ella takes a job as a reader for a literary agent and is drawn to an unknown European author named Aziz Zahara when she is assigned to read his novel, Sweet Blasphemy. When the novel speaks of love exactly the way she had to her daughter, it is almost as if the book had been written with her in mind. This begins her quest for, among other things, love and spirituality.

	An e-mail correspondence begins and the love story of Ella and Aziz unfolds. Also developed is the story in Sweet Blasphemy, which tells, as a story within a story, a historical tale of a bond between the thirteenth-century poet Rumi and Sufi mystic Shams. Aziz is a world traveler and a photographer by trade. He becomes a Sufi as he tries to find his place of comfort in life. His deep interest in Shams of Tabriz and the poetry of Rumi inspired him to write Sweet Blasphemy. The e-mails he sends to Ella have content rich with romance and spirituality. Through Aziz’s words, Ella learns to believe that there are things she is unable to control and needs to accept in order to find her own comfortable self-image. He helps her move past the judgmental view of herself she has been controlled by.

	The main character of Sweet Blasphemy is Shams of Tabriz. When he was young, he had visions. Receiving no understanding or support from his parents, he eventually leaves home to search for God. On his journey into the world, he visits shrines, temples, and monasteries. He spends time meditating with hermits and among heretics. He dances with shamans. He sees miracles and tragedies among people from all walks of life and of all faiths. He assembles a list of his experiences, referring to it as “The Basic Principles of the Itinerant Mystics of Islam,” made up of universal principles that together form “The Forty Rules of the Religion of Love,” attainable only through love.

	Shams uses stories that are thought-provoking to transform Rumi from an unknown preacher into a widely famous mystic and poet. He affects many lives as the journey progresses, including those of a leper, a drunk, and Kimya, who is the adopted daughter of Rumi. The author shows that Rumi’s philosophy from the thirteenth century is still relevant in the twenty-first century. That love is not culturally bound is a significant theme. Also explored is the timelessness of the clashes between different civilizations and religions. Ella is of the mind that fanatical religious beliefs are as much an issue in the present as in the past.

	Structurally, The Forty Rules of Love is untraditional. It was originally written in English and translated into Arabic. It is a first-person narrative that intersperses letters and e-mails into the text along with the theosophy of Shams’s forty rules of love. Each chapter begins with the letter “b” because to Sufi mystics the “b” or “ba” is the first letter par excellence because it opens the Basmala, “In the name of God, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.”

	The Daily Star of Bangladesh said of The Forty Rules of Love, “At a time when the religion of Islam is being tarnished by media images of terror and violence, Shafak’s novel breathes a fresh new light into the Islamic worldview and the practice of religious meditation by some of its adherents. Different chapters of the novel are narrated from the point of view of different characters, making the whole an unbiased narrative; this narrative strategy would appear to be crucial for a work concerning love, religion, and spirituality. Shafak’s personal interest and experience of Sufism is reflected in the richness of the work, making it noteworthy not only for her fans and but also worthwhile for all readers of compelling fiction.”</p>
